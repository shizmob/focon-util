## Usage

### Displays

Supported displays will have two connectors on the side, labeled `X1` and `X2`, with the following pin-out:

X1:
```
  /-------------------\
A | 1  -  3  4  5  6  |
B | 1  2  3  4  5  6  |
  ---------------------

A1 - Power GND
B1 - Power Vcc
B2 - NC
 3: Addr0
 4: Addr1
 5: Addr2
 6: Addr3
```

X2:
```
  /-------\
Y | 1 2 3 |
  |-------|
X | 1 2 3 |
  ---------

X1: RS485 IN-
X2: RS485 IN+
Y1: RS485 OUT-
Y2: RS485 OUT+
 3: GND
```

Connect a 60-140V DC power supply to pins B1 and A1, and bridge the address pin pairs as desired (or leave them all unbridged for ID 0).
Connect a RS485 transceiver to pins X1, X2, and X3, and a 120 ohm terminating resistor between Y1 and Y2.

Now, use any of the display subcommands to talk to the device, passing the path to your serial device using `-d` and the device address using `-i`:

```
